NEW FEATURES
    o The package have successfully been installed on Windows machines, 
    although only basic functionalities have been tested (see README file).
    o Support for Mac have also started, although even more slightly, using
    the Octave version available from homebrew.

CHANGES
    o Moved all developments/bug reports/static docs to GitHub repository:
    https://github.com/renozao/RcppOctave/ 
    o Octave functions' stdout and stderr messages are now buffered by default, so 
    that it does not bypass R own i/o functions.
    All messages/warnings sent to stdout/stderr from Octave are displayed on 
    exiting the function call.
    o function .CallOctave gains a new argument buffer.std to enable/disable 
    stdout and/or stderr buffering (see ?.CallOctave).
    o Octave startup warnings (e.g. shadowing of core functions by Octave modules) 
    are not shown anymore.
    o Minor adaptations to pass new CRAN checks
    o The package now depends on R >= 3.0.0 to properly handle the knitr vignettes.
    o Errors are now more properly handled, thanks to hints found in this 
    old post by Romain François:
    http://lists.r-forge.r-project.org/pipermail/rcpp-devel/2010-May/000651.html
