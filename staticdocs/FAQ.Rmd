# Frequently Asked Questions

## What version of Octave is supported/recommended?

Versions later than 3.2.4 should be supported, however, we recommend to use version 3.6.2 or later.
See question about the installation error due to library liboctinterp in Octave 3.2.4.

Octave 3.6.2 is on the official Ubuntu Quantal (12.11) repository, but can be installed on Ubuntu Precise LTS (12.04) and older from the ppa __ppa:octave/stable__ :

```
 sudo add-apt-repository ppa:octave/stable
 sudo apt-get update
 sudo apt-get install octave liboctave-dev
```

## Why RcppOctave does not install correctly with Octave 3.2.4 due to liboctinterp.so?

We don't really know what suddenly caused this issue, which comes from the fact that liboctinterp.so is not found when loading RcppOctave's own library.

The following work around seems to work for most users: 
```
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:`octave-config -p OCTLIBDIR`
Rscript -e "install.packages('RcppOctave')"
```
<small>Thanks to Cheng Zhang: http://jchain.github.com/blog/2013/01/28/install-rcppoctave-if-octave/</small>

Otherwise the latest version on R-forge (>= 0.8.17) should work out of the box in Octave 3.2.4:

```{r rforge, eval=FALSE}
install.packages('RcppOctave', repos=c(getOption('repos'), 'http://r-forge.r-project.org'))
```
